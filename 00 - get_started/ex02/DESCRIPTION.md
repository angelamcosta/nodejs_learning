# Exercise 2: Working with .env Files

## Problem:

Create a Node.js script that reads the values from a .env file and logs them to the console.

## Instructions:

- Create a new file named `app.js`.
- In the same directory, create a `.env` file and define some key-value pairs. For example:

``` bash
FIRST_NAME=<your_name>
LAST_NAME=<your_last_name>
```

- Write the necessary code in `app.js` to read the values from the `.env` file.
- Use a library like `dotenv` to load the values from the `.env` file into environment variables.
- Log the values to the console using `console.log()`.
- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `app.js` and `.env` are located.
- Run the script using the `node app.js` command.
- Verify that the values from the `.env` file are logged to the console.
