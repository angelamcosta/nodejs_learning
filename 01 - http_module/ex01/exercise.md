# Exercise 1: Making an HTTP GET Request

## Problem:

Write a program that makes an HTTP GET request to the URL "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" and prints the response data to the console.

# Instructions:

- Create a new file named `app.js`.
- In your `app.js` file, require the module `http`.
- Create a `const` to hold the options for your request.
- Use the `http.request` to make the `GET` request.
- Log the results.
